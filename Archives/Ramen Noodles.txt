Ramen Noodles

Ramen (/ˈrɑːmən/) is a Japanese dish with a translation of "pulled noodles". It consists of Chinese wheat noodles served in a meat or (occasionally) fish-based broth, often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork, nori (dried seaweed), menma, and scallions. Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen, such as the tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu and the miso ramen of Hokkaido. Mazemen is the name of a ramen dish that is not served in a soup, but rather with a sauce (such as tare), like noodles that are served with a sweet and sour sauce.

Ramen is a Japanese[2] adaptation of Chinese wheat noodles.[3][4][5][6][7] One theory says that ramen was first introduced to Japan during the 1660s by the Chinese neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Shunsui who served as an advisor to Tokugawa Mitsukuni after he became a refugee in Japan to escape Manchu rule and Mitsukuni became the first Japanese person to eat ramen, although most historians reject this theory as a myth created by the Japanese to embellish the origins of ramen.[8] The more plausible theory is that ramen was introduced by Chinese immigrants in the late 19th[3][9] or early 20th century at Yokohama Chinatown.[10][11] According to the record of the Yokohama Ramen Museum, ramen originated in China and made its way over to Japan in 1859.[9] Early versions were wheat noodles in broth topped with Chinese-style roast pork.[3]
